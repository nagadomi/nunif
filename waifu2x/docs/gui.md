# waifu2x Graphical User Interface

The following line executes the GUI.
```
python -m waifu2x.gui
```
This GUI is optimized for Windows. (Linux can cut off text.)

if you need run gui.py with out "`python -m waifu2x.gui`" run this file `__main__.py`

## TODO
- ~~Command Processing~~ (It runs fine, but I made the log appear on the interface, but I don't know because there seems to be no log...?)
